# Convolution dataset 0001

Dataset for convolution programs.

Other shapes are extracted from known networks using this service:
http://dgschwend.github.io/netscope/quickstart.html (see _Presets_ there).

AUTOGENERATED!
The `shape-*` files are automatically generated from the `data.csv` file via the `tool-prepare-dataset` program.
Please do not edit any of the `shape-*` files manually. Please edit `data.csv` and re-run `tool-prepare-dataset` instead.
