*There are numerous CK components spread across numerous GitHub repositories. 
Based on the feedback from the community, we have created this repository 
to collect all the main CK components related to AI and ML Systems in one place. 
These components are also uploaded to the [cKnowledge.io platform](https://cKnowledge.io) 
similar to PyPI to help you search for specific components and see their connections!*

This repository contains a collection of **stable** CK components 
for ML systems in the [CK format](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01149.pdf)
hosted by the [non-profit cTuning foundation](https://cTunin.org):

* CK modules with automation actions: [[list](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/tree/master/ck/repo/module)]
* CK program workflows: [[list]( https://cKnowledge.io/programs )]
* CK meta packages: [[list]( https://cKnowledge.io/packages )]
* CK software detection: [[list]( https://cKnowledge.io/soft )]
